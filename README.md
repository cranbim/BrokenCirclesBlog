What we thought and learned as we thought and learned it

Broken Circles is a Data Prototype project by the Organised Art Syndicate, funded by [SWCTN](https://www.swctn.org.uk/data/) (the South West Creative Technology Network). The prototype investigates motivations and encouragements for citizens to buy and behave in the Circular Economy, to find their voices, and exercise choices in ways that send a message to supply chains to do better. The protoype aims to deliver data driven storytelling to allow citizens to understand the impact onf their choices, and find out where and how they have influence. This will take the form of web based interactive tools, a citizen toolkit, an interactive exhibit, and art.

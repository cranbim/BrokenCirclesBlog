Following a successful paper submision to the SWCTN Data Prototype open call, we were invited to a pitch and interview on 21st October. This was of course quite intimidating, even via zoom. We went over our material again and again, adding, removing, editing. The content was too big and unstrcutured to clearly express our idea and aour ability to deliver it. With lots of help and critical feedback from advisors, and last minute changes, we delivered a pitche we were happy with. Questioning was probing, fair and not hostile. We finished feeling that if we did not get funded, it was not becasue we failed to deliver a good account of our idea, ourselves, and our network.
SWCTN took longer than expected to get back to us. On 3rd November at 4:24pm I got a WhatsAPp message from Jon which said simply: _Call me when you can_.
